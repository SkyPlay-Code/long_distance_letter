            <p>Yesterday night I wrote a short note for you, but I didn't send it, so here it is:</p>
            <p>So, um, start kaha se karu. Ok, I know ki abhi tumhe lag raha hoga ki everything is going to end. But ok, it's not. Abhi toh bas start hua hai. Yeah, without physical touch or without seeing for years can hurt. Mujhe bhi yeh bahut chubta hai as if I don't want to do anything. As if I don't want to go ahead. Lekin hame aage jana hi padega. U already know about it, right? Tumne mujhe console karne ke liye kitne sare voice notes bheje the, isn't it? Yeh padhte hue shayad tumhe rone ka man kar raha hoga. It's ok. Everything is ok. Hum ek dusre ko kitne dino tak nahi mile. But we talked in chats, calls & video calls too. Humne ghar baithe hi kitne maje kiye.</p>
            <p>Ik tumhare liye enough nahi hai. We both are desperate, but we truly love each other, right? And ye sach me itna strong hai, then we both can wait for each other for years without having a single change in our feelings. Start hamesha thoda mushkil hota hai but we have to start from somewhere.</p>
            <p>And I promise that it will lead to a good place. I already imagined many things from start to end. First tum jab 11th me jaoge, you will feel alone and depressed, but at that time hum ek dusre ke liye wait kar rahe honge ki ghar pahunch ke aaj sab kuch batana hai. Everyday at least we can't talk but we can feel the presence of each other. Kyuki ek msg hi kafi hota hai to make sure the other person is there. And maybe, I am not sure lekin 11th mein mera personal phone ayega then we can talk pretty much of the time. Maybe hum ek dusre ko har din mil na paye. But har din hum ek nayi motivation mein uthke ek dusre ke baare mein sochte hue kuch na kuch alag karenge. Tumhe apne dreams ke liye & mujhe apne dreams ke liye mehnat karna hai then both of our parents will be satisfied. Then we can wish for anything. It's not going be 10 years for sure, because after 12th, maybe in college, we may get chances, various occasions. Han, yeh baat hai ki hum distance mein rahenge lekin kabhi bhi hame chance mile, I will surely come, for you at least. And after both of us have achieved our dreams, we both can step together to our final dream. So even now abhi tumhe jo dard ho raha hai, don't make it tear you up. Make it the reason to go ahead. From my side I can always say, I am always there for you. I will always be the same as I am now. But I am always worried about you because until you are in school, everyone is there. But afterwards, promise me you will always be safe. Nothing will happen to you. Because that's the thing that aches my heart the most. It has made me tear up multiple times. Your life may be challenging but it's not punishing. Through these challenges, I will be your biggest supporter. So don't worry about anything... Because in the end of the day we will still & always be together.</p>
            <p>You have the strength that no one has.</p>
            <p>You can go ahead so much.</p>
            <p>So don't let anything stop you. Because I will also be there in need.</p>
            <p>So just tum abhi jaise ho waise hi rehna usi smile ke Saath, kyuki sab kuch jaise hai waise hi tha and waise hi rahega.</p>
            <p>So let's go ahead at the same time. Don't worry about anything. We will always be together. Forever.</p>
